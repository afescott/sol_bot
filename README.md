IN PROGRESS

Bin exec dedicated to finding newly minted tokens on the solana blockchain. Then using dex screener combined with rug checkers/token sniffer to find legit tokenomics


Notes
TODO:

A) // asynchronously check:
1) dex_screener  
2) legit non scam attributes

https://solintel.io/token/CqWRZJcDE7GXWvgA9CHMnksDf6p1VmZ49Rg5a9WiCsRK

B) In memory storage via Arc hashmaps based on token type whilst liquidity is not added on Raydium 













// in memory state control like the web api?

// store the values into structs (might have to be generic)
//excel spreadsheet to record starting from $1 each crypto 
//filter and every 5 minutes pick the best out of the bunch? Online algorithm? vesting also important

currently endlessly looping to check when enhanced transactions are available. need to add to stack and when found remove from stack
//next steps:  store enhanced transactions. how long do these need to be stored for? They're models so
